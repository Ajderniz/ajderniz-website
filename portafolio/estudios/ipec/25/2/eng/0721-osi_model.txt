osi model: explains how data travels thru networks

open systems interconnection

each layer hangles a specific part of transferring data between devices

layers:
	1 physical: hardware, wired-wireless
	2 data link: makes sure data flows without errors
	3 network: handles the data routing, "like a gps"? assigns ip address to packets
	4 transport: makes sure the data arrives properly at the final destination
	5 session: sets up, manages and closes connections between devices
	6 presentation: translates/encrypts data into a format both devices understand
	7 application: the layer the user interacts with directly

example: sending a file
	1: device connects to wifi to start a transmission
	2: prepares file for sending, checks for errors
	3: assigns destination's ip address to packets
	4: file splits file into packets and sends them individually
	5: sets up a session between the communicating devices
	6: encrypts file and checks it's safe
	7: recipient looks at the file through a client
