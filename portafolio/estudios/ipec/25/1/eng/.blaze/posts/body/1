<h2>1. Feelings</h1>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that this was not going to be
	another endless cycle of learning the <i>VERBO TU 'BI</i>. As I
	understood it, we are rather to be taught several aspects relating to
	the IT context, under different topics, through an immersive/input
	language learning method. We have content, organization, and a method!
	</p>
	<p>
	The teach' does this thing where he uses his body language to convey the
	messages says in English, thus helping everybody understand, through
	context and demonstration, the general--and not so general--idea.
	</p>
	<p>
	He did this during his first assignment. First, he wrote on the
	whiteboard the instruction for what to do; then, he went on to say out
	lout each and every instruction, whilst making sure he was understood by
	every class student.
	</p>

<h2>2. Expectations</h1>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	What do I expect for this course? First and foremost, I hope to learn
	information that I haven't learned; otherwise, it would be lost time,
	and lost effort.
	</p>
	<p>
	As to what I personally expect for myself, I expect to be pushed into
	finally <i>gittin' gud</i> at networking and so on, always ensuring that
	I am the one who controls my own stuff.
	</p>
</div>
<p>
By the way, I don't expect to be this verbose about every single entry I do. I'm
just a bit excited today, that's all. My usual output is very minimal if I don't
feel like it's worth the effort to write about something.
