<h2> Long answer</h2>

<h3>1. What is connectivity?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  "The ability of differente devices and systems to establish a connection and
  communicate with each other."
	</p>
</div>

<h3>2. What are the steps involved in establishing connectivity between
devices?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
  <ol>
    <li>Device identification</li>
    <li>Network infrastructure</li>
    <li>Data transmission</li>
    <li>Routing</li>
    <li>Protocols</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h3>3. Why is connectivity important in today's interconnected world?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  Because it enables and powers "data transfer, collaboration, and access to
  inormation", al in the name of Mammon.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>4. What is the role of protocols in connectivity?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  They determine the way in which data is transmitted and received across the
  network.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>5. Name a commonly used protocol for internet communication?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  TCP/IP
	</p>
</div>

<h3>6. What is the purpose of a router in a network?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  They redirect the flow of data through the analysis of packet headers, routing
  them toward their intended direction.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>7. How does a switch contribute to network communication?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  They 'multiply' the amount of data flows that a network can admit, acting as a
  'switch' between many different wired connections.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>8. What is the function of a modem in connectivity?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  They convert analog data (coming from the wired ISP-provided connection) into
  digital information and vice-versa.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>9. What are some exmples of wireless connectivity technologies?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
  <ul>
    <li>Wi-Fi</li>
    <li>Bluetooth</li>
    <li>
      Cellular networks:
      <ul>
        <li>3G</li>
        <li>4G</li>
        <li>5G</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>10. Define Internet of Things (Iot) and explain its reliance on
connectivity</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  It's this thing where a bunch of day-to-day objects are turned into networked
  devices for absolutely no reason. Since to be 'smart' they need to be
  connected to a network, they rely on connectivity.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>11. What are some commonly used protocols for web communication?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
  <ul>
    <li>TCP/IP</li>
    <li>HTTP/HTTPS</li>
    <li>Ethernet</li>
    <li>Wi-Fi</li>
    <li>Bluetooth</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>12. How does Ethernet contribute to wired connectivity?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  It enables wired connections within LANs.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>13. Name a wireless protocol used for connecting smartphones and IoT
devices</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  Bluetooth
	</p>
</div>

<h3>14. What is the role of a wireless access point (WAP) in a network?</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  Acting, as their name suggests, as access points to devices which use a
  wireless connection in order to communicate.
	</p>
</div>

<h3>15. Differentiate between a wide area network (WAN) and a local area
network (LAN)</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
  A LAN is usually limited to the area occupied by a building or a small
  enclosed facility. A WAN is made up of LANs, and its range can be up tothat of
  a city.
	</p>
