<h2>1. What is an embedded system?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	"An embedded system is a special-purpose computer, custom-built to serve
	a specific purpose."
	</p>
</div>
<h2>2. What is a specific purpose device or computer?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	A custom-made computer, made to serve a particular function.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>3. What are general purpose devices or computers?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Computers that we use every day--as in, <em>consciously</em> use, being
	aware that they are computers--, which are designed to fulfill more than
	one purpose.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>4. Write 3 examples of specific purpose devices</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<ul>
		<li>Calculators</li>
		<li>Digital wristwatches</li>
		<li>Electronic typewriters</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h2>5. Write 3 examples of general-purpose devices</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<ul>
		<li>Desktop and laptop PCs</li>
		<li>Smartphones and tablets</li>
		<li>Smart TVs and other unnecesarily "smart" devices</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h2>6. What are the three types of embedded systems?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<ul>
		<li>Subsystem</li>
		<li>Standalone system</li>
		<li>Networked system</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h2>7. Define and write two examples of every embedded system</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<b>Subsystem</b>: The origin of the therm "embedded system".
		This one's a sub-part of another system. Two examples are:
		<ul>
			<li>A digital dashboard, embedded into a car.</li>
			<li>
			A computerized controller, embedded into a home
			appliance, like a microwave oven or a washing machine's
			console.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>Standalone system</b>: The device performs its own thing,
		independently. Two examples are:
		<ul>
			<li>An MP3 player.</li>
			<li>A digital camera.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>Networked system</b>: A group of <em>physically separate</em>
		electronic devices, which perform a collective function. When
		seen from a global perspective, this is the abomination they
		call the "Internet of Things". Two examples are:
		<ul>
			<li>A remotely-operated AC system.</li>
			<li>
			A door on the front of your house, that closes in on you
			if it hears you say no-no words banned by Google.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
