  A recap of a little introduction we got from le teach:
	</p>
  <p>
  You have your rings, your stars, your buses and your meshes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Rings</b> consist of a series of hosts connected to each other in a
    linear manner. This topology loops, hence the name. These are not very
    stable, mostly because of potential connection failures.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Stars</b> have a core host, which acts as the "heart" of the server. To
    this core is connected a series of outer hosts. Each is connected to the
    core via one separate line. This is a centralized topology.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Buses</b> are a linear topology, like rings. This topology does not loop,
    however, making it even more fragile than the ring topology.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Meshes</b> are a decentralized topology, consisting of a series of hosts
    interconnected in an unorganized manner. This topology is much more reliable
    than any of the others previously discussed, but is, in turn, more costly
    and difficult to set up. This topology, however, is quite common.
    </li>
  </ul>

  I don't know how many years it's been since I last did one of these.
