<h2>What is Microsoft Word?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Do you really need me to explain what that is? Word. It's Word. The word
	processor everyone uses, and that now has an implementation that sucks
	on that cloud thing. What was it called? 365? It's got a different name
	now, right? These MS MFs really love terrible naming conventions.
	</p>
	<p>
	But really, I can't stand using the web browser version, same as the
	other members of the Office suite. I've had to use it so many times over
	the years, and it's like it manages to find new, unique ways to keep
	getting worse. Really makes you think, how is it that we've allowed
	software to get this bad-
	</p>
</div>
<h2>How to write documents</h2>
<h3>(on Word or on anything really)</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	I've got a secret, secret secret. I have the key to stop all word
	processor-related suffering around the globe. Guess what it is!
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>THAT'S RIGHT!</strong> Wait, no, that's not it. I meant content,
	focus on content. Formatting and styling comes later-unless you've got a
	template, in which case you can already focus on the content.
	</p>
	<p>
	And what do I mean by "focusing on content", you ask? Well, it's simple,
	when you want to write a document, all you need to worry about is
	writing a damn good document, not about the margins, the indentations,
	the font types, sizes, styles...
	</p>
	<p>
	There is still space for semantics and hierarchical organization, as
	these help to better arrange the flow of the content; but, generally
	speaking, all there is to that is very simple, and can be found in
	simpler document formatting tools, such as Markdown.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Markdown plug</h2>
<h3>(I don't even use it that much)</h3>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Aside from headers and lists, Markdown offers little in the way of
	document formatting, so it is an ideal language for writing documents
	which focus on the content. Because it is written in plaintext, it is
	also lightweight and does not need a bloated suite to edit or render.
	</p>
	<p>
	Yet, if you do not like the idea of using Notepad to write a serious
	document, and are, for example, forced into a situation where you must
	stick to an outdated, aesthetically deplorable format, such as a college
	paper, with a cover, table of contents and all that, you can always use
	your fatty little Word thing. I'm not your dad.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the end, though, you'll notice that the most outlandish features
	you'll ever use will be things like graphics and tables (the last of
	which, by the way, Markdown also supports).
	</p>
