<h2>Of the bits and the flowers</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Once upon a time, there was a <em>bit</em> of data so small, its only
	name could be that of "bit". It could only hold a value which swayed
	between one value and the other, and nothing else. An eternal
	<i>YES-NO</i>, <i>ON-OFF</i>, <i>0-1</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
	And what of the flowers? I don't know.

<h2>And along came the byte</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	The thing about bits, is that they were very small, and meaningless, by
	themselves; and there were too many of them, even in the older
	computers. It was not very practical to have every sigle bit have a
	house by itself, since it would take the same amount of bits as there
	were on a machine, just to properly be able to address them.
	</p>
	<p>
	So a bunch of bits decided to get together and form a row of--usually--8
	bits. This way, they could represent values and have reasonably-sized,
	8, 16, 32, and then 64-bit addresses.

<h2>In the beginning was the Word...</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	... and the Word was an arranged set of bits, similar to the byte; in
	this case, the lenght of a word was--again, usually--32 bits, or what's
	to say, 4 bytes. After the word, larger arrangements were the long word
	(64-bits or 8 bytes), and the quad word (128-bits or 16 bytes).
