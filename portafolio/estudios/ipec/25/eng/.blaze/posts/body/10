<h2>The IPO model</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	No matter the intricacies of a computer program, its base structure can
	be summarized as being composed of three key steps: Input, Process and
	Output, shortened to IPO.
	</p>

</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	The <b><i>I</i></b> in IPO stands for Input. Input is the information
	that feeds the process, so that it can produce a result according to it.
	Input can be generated directly by the user, but it can also be the
	output of another process. When generated by the user, a device is
	needed in order to provide the user with an interface to enter the
	information with.
	</p>
	<p>
	Some common input devices are keyboards,

	joysticks,

	and barcode scanners.

</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Like <i>I</i>, the <i><b>O</i></b> in IPO stands for Output. Output is
	the final result of the process, and is used either as the input for
	another process, or represented to the user as the outcome of a program.
	Some devices used to display the output of a program are headphones,

	screens,
	<img class="framed-img" src="monitor.jpg" alt="a keyboard">
	printers,
	<img class="framed-img" src="printer.jpg" alt="a keyboard">
	and speakers.

</div>
<h2>Mixed devices</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	There are also some devices which offer a hybrid functionality, acting
	both as input and output devices. Some of these are cameras,
	<img class="framed-img" src="webcam.jpg" alt="a keyboard">
	touchscreens,
	<img class="framed-img" src="touchscreen.jpg" alt="a keyboard">
	CD/DVD readers with write functionality,
	<img class="framed-img" src="cd_dvd_reader.jpg" alt="a keyboard">
	and Internet modems.
