<h2>What's the deeeeal with that?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	<i>Too</i> and <i>enough</i> are, somewhat, opposite. While <i>too</i>
	indicates an excess of something, <i>enough</i> implies an adecuate
	amount; therefore, they are not, strictly speaking, opposites, but
	convey different enough meanings to be observed in a contrasting manner.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	One example use of <i>too</i> in a way that communicates an excess, is
	if I were to say:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	This portfolio thing has taken too much out of my very limited reserve
	of time.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	And an example of <i>enough</i> being used to convey an adecuate amount,
	is the following:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	I think I've written enough of this stuff already. I got other stuff to
	do.
	</blockquote>
</div>
