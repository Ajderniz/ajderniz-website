<h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	The Internet of Things, (usually shortened as <i>IoT</i>) is a
	technology that enables <strong>UNNECESSARY</strong>, networked 
	communication between... things.
	</p>
	<p>
	So, essentially, we're talking about "things", as in, otherwise
	"useless" stuff, with a NIC (Network Interface Card) attached to it, so
	that it can send your private informtion to someone else's computer.
	</p>

<h2>What does a IoT device need?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	It's hard to write when you're being distracted by three different
	things going on around you.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<b>Embedded systems</b>: A tiny, specialized computer, attached
		to your useless thing.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>NIC</b>: The component that, majorly, enables, networked,
		wireless communication originating from the thing.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>((((THE CLOUD))))</b>: Here we go. This is absolutely not
		needed. No cloud is needed for an IoT device to work. But
		whatever, yes, THECLOUD is MANDATORY for... reasons.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>((((BIG DATA))))</b>: Another horrifying term, being treated
		as if it were the most beautiful thing ever. We got flash
		storage now, and it's not that hard to set up a private
		network-attached storage (NAS) unit. But you know, what? Yes,
		people, are willing to sell their privay (and freedom), just for
		a itty bitty taste of all that convenience.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>((((MACHINE LEARNING))))</b>: Lord. Yet another one. of
		these. Yeah, yeah, big computer do big calculation, and ACTIVELY
		LOGS ALL OF YOUR ACTIONS JUST TO PROFILE YOUR PERSONALITY. They
		say sex sells, but you know what sells even more? PRIVATE
		INFORMATION.
		</li>
	</ol>
