<h2>What is an Operating System?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Computers are dumb, right? The thing with computers, is that the full
	potential of a powerful computer, would be wasted if it were set up to
	perform one, and only one task. This is how primitive computers
	operated, and it required lots of unaided thinking to even put a new
	program into a multi-purpose computer. So, operating systems were
	invented, or so I would guess.
	</p>
	<p>
	In essence, an operating system (or OS) is a computer program that deals
	with the hardware of the computer, thus providing the user with an
	interface with which they can perform many different tasks, more or
	less, seamlessly. There are many layers to an OS, and as the years have
	passed since the introduction of consumer-grade personal
	micro-computers, OS have become more and more complex.
	</p>
	<p>
	At the most basic level, the core of an OS is called the <i>kernel</i>,
	and it is just what was described in the previous paragraph: an
	intermediary between the physical and the virtual. Still, an OS can be
	more than just the kernel, as many application-level programs are
	developed as part of the OS's core environment. Take Windows: neither
	Paint nor File Explorer are fundamental to the OS's functionality, but
	they come included as part of the OS nonetheless.

<h2>Some examples</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	There have been, and are, many OSes, and they will continue to exist and
	be developed for a long time (unless this miserable existence ends in
	five years or so). The OS one thinks of usually, is what I'd call the
	user OS: examples are the pile of garbage we call Windows,
	<img class="framed-img" src="./bsod.jpg" alt="the best os ever">
	macOS, the walled-off-garden,
	<img class="centered-img" src="./macos.png" alt="the other evil">
	and Linux, the third-class citizen of OSes.

	</p>
	<p>
	Still, an OS is anything that helps a computer run multiple tasks. Tiny
	devices, such as clocks, water heater controllers, oven consoles,
	calculators, work with an OS. These are usually developed with low power
	consumption in mind, and give access to a limited set of functions.
