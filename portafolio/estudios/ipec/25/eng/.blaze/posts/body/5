<h2>What is Office Automation?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Office Automation is a... <i>thing</i>, which helps <em>us</em> be
	more efficient in the worship of Mammon. It is not meant to replace
	human effort, but rather <em>enhance</em> it, or so they say. Examples
	of Office Automation can belong to both software-such as word
	processors-and hardware-such as printers.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>What is Office Mechanization</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Office Mechanization is yet another type of <i>thing</i>. In this case,
	it does not help, it replaces, which can be considered a kind of help, I
	guess. An example of Office Mechanization, limited strictly to the
	computer context, can be the spell-checker function in many word
	processor programs, as this task could've been a whole trade before.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>What's the difference?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	There is a very thin layer separating mechanization from automation. It
	really depends on the specific moment in time you have the misfortune to
	witness the relevant technology from. Word processors came to replace
	typewriters, thus effectively replacing people whom had specialized in
	typewriting, as it had now become easier for everyone to write.
	</p>
	<p>
	On the other hand, automation does not outright eliminate a task, and
	instead streamlines it, making it easier, faster, more effective. When
	you talk about mechanization, you are referring to a complete
	replacement.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>Are these things any good for society?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Yes, they are. In fact, not only is automation good, mechanization is
	also good. Anything that reduces the amount of toil a man ought to do is
	good. Free time means creativity, and creativity means... good?
	</p>
	<p>
	And yet, even more than a hundred years after it was deemed that
	machinery had effectively eliminated the need for hard labor in many 
	areas, we still hold on to that sweet, sweet lie, that a man must be a
	slave, lest he be a lazy waste of resources.
	</p>
	<p>
	How is it that we praise the inventiveness of these new gizmos, and how
	they reduce costs and the need for workers; how companies can now fire
	those pesky, replaceable grunts, and have the robots that they've always
	wanted; and still we need to go to work 6-6, and suffer the humiliation
	of being called incompetent, after years and years and even more years
	of hard work, getting ready to receive a piece of paper that certifies
	you as a worthy soul? I don't know, do you?
	</p>
	<p>
	So, I don't know, maybe it's not the machine's fault, it's man's, that
	we are slaves. But office automation is good.
	</p>
