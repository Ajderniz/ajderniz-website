<h2>What is a computer?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>

	"A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a
	list of instructions." Right, so, the funny part about the eymology of
	the term 'computer' is that--exactly--it implies the manipulation of
	data, and more specifically, number-crunching.
	</p>
	</p>
	In the brief window of time where advanced technologies were being
	developed, but computers did not exist in the same capacity as they do
	now, a computer was a person. A human computer would calculate countless
	mathematical operations, whose yield would somehow affect a process such
	as determining the trajectory of a missle. That's what I've heard,
	anyways.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you put it that way, a 'puter is, in fact, a mechanized computer,
	and an automated one as well (I'm still not sure there really is a
	difference).

<h2>Parts of a computer (peripherals)</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	A computer consists of many components, often called 'peripherals'.
	</p>
	<p>
	You got your monitors,
	<img class="framed-img" src="./monitor.jpg" alt="pic of a 'puter monitor">
	your keyboards,
	<img class="framed-img" src="./keyboard.jpg" alt="pic of a 'puter keyboard">
	your mice,
	<img class="framed-img" src="./mouse.jpg" alt="pic of a 'puter mouse">
	your speakers,
	<img class="framed-img" src="./speakers.jpg" alt="pic of a 'puter case">
	all of which are hooked up to a black box, which--if you live in the
	post-Christian-Rapture era, beginning in 2012--will probably come with a
	warranty seal, stating that if you dare as much as unscrew the lid of
	the case off, your warranty will be voided and your CID (citizen ID),
	logged into the VABL (Vendor Avoidance Blacklist).

	Also, there's this thing. It looks like a TV, but it's pretty cool
	still.
