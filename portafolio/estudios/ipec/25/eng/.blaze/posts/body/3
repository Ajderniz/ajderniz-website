<h1>Office Automation Worksheet</h1>
<h2>1. What is office mechanization?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	c) Office mechanization is the process of replacing old
	technology with new.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>2. What is a software suite?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	b) A software suite is a collection of computer tools
	that manages, gathers, and displays data.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>3. How does office automation save space?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	c) Files and data are saved in the computer system and
	not hard copy
	</p>
</div>
<h2>4. What is the largest challenge of office automation?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	b) Technology hiccups
	</p>
</div>
<h2>5. How can office automation save time?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	b) It can save time by letting technology do calculation
	and management, allowing for employees to tackle larger
	tasks.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>6. Write one example from an office suite</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	LibreOffice. I hate it.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>7. What is a Bit?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	It is the smallest amount of data possible. It
	represents a state of 0/1, ON/OFF, YES/NO.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>8. What is a Byte?</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	In modern personal computers, a byte is a set of 8
	adjacent bits.
	</p>
	<p>
	Throughout the history of computing this
	number has shifted slightly, and there are still some
	devices which utilize distinct amounts of bits.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you wanna get technical, you can define a byte as the
	smallest amount of <em>addressable</em> data possible.
	</p>
</div>
<h2>9. What is the difference between 32 bits and 64 bits computer></h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	I kinda forgot about this, so I had to look it up.
	Funnily enough, its kinda related to the previous
	question. So, what 32-bit and 64-bit refers to is the
	amount of bits a memory (RAM) address contains.
	</p>
	<p>
	Let us remeber what I said on the previous answer, that a
	byte is the least amount of <em>addressable</em> data a
	modern PC's processor can point to. Each byte is
	represented by one of these 32-bit addresses; so, in
	essence, a 32-bit computer is capable of having 32-bits
	worth of RAM, while a 64-bit computer is capable of
	64-bits worth of RAM.
	</p>
	<p>
	I'd do the math, but I'm dumb, so I'll copy what came up
	on the search query: with 32-bits, you can access up to
	4GB, while with 64-bits, you can access, theoretically,
	up to 18.4 million terabytes, which is, by current
	standards, <em>a lot</em>.

<h2>10. What are the two exmaples of technology you can see in the office</h2>
<div class=bluebox>
	<p>
	Software and hardware :)
	</p>
</div>
