	In case you didn't notice what directory this section is under, this is
	meant to be a portfolio for a class. Since there is no written law that
	restricts the format a portfolio must be written in, I do not believe a
	blog format is too far a stretch, when wanting to organize entries
	chronologically and by categories. It certainly beats a PowerPoint
	presentation.
